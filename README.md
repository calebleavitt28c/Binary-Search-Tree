I wrote the node.h, node.cpp, binarysearchtree.h and binarysearchtree.cpp files. The rest were provided by my instuctor at the time.

In this application recursion is used insert, search, remove, perform an in-order traversal, print and check the size of the tree. 
All of these functions are found in binarysearchtree.h and binarysearchtree.cpp
